I liken myself to Ratatouille, a French vegetable stew with a unique flavor created by combining a variety of ingredients. Despite being cosmopolitan, I have a racially ambiguous appearance and am frequently questioned, "What is your ethnicity?" by residents in my less varied neighborhood. With a few prominent characteristics or tastes, my "half caucasian" remark elicits not just incredulity but also a rapid "No, you're not!" It's odd to imagine that people would dismiss my ethnicity as if I were mistaken. Although I phenotypically resemble a Filipino, I am a genetic mix of Asian Pacific Islander, Russian, Jewish, Irish, Welsh, and English thanks to my parents.My parents were the first in their families to marry interracially, breaking generations of family custom. My parents were not only of different nationalities, but also of different religions, with my father coming from a Jewish family and my mother from a Catholic family. Not just in size, but also in family rituals such as holiday festivities, their families are vastly different. My sister and I are the offspring of a newly evolved mixed-race society.Growing up, I benefited from my parents', grandparents', and other relatives' drastically varied and frequently competing views on social and political topics. Their respective cultures, norms, and traditions have affected their own viewpoints. As a consequence, I am able to interact with individuals on a variety of levels, whether politically or culturally, in order to find common ground in our perspectives. I've always known that physical and cultural distinctions exist, but that we are all valuable individuals. I've also realized that, at their core, everyone wants the same things: to live in safety and to be able to feed their family.America's originality, like Ratatouille's, is the consequence of several contributions of various and frequently clashing aspects that, when combined, create the whole more delicious than its separate components. Because of the divisions I've seen in terms of race, religion, and culture, I want to be someone who helps to break down those barriers and has those talks to find a location or issue of agreement where race and color are ignored. I want to major in Business and minor in Political Science, and then go to law school, based on what I've learned.As a lawyer, I will advocate for people who are marginalized and silenced due to their appearance, religious views, sexual orientation, or impairments. I'd like to be able to provide the silent and devalued a platform. I wish to be in a position where I can encourage the consideration of various voices, perspectives, and points of view so that they, too, may succeed in their companies while contributing to and benefiting from our society.I am pleased that I am the child of parents from two entirely different cultures and religions, and that I am a result of numerous components with distinct flavors. Being biracial has given me the ability to see things from many perspectives. As a result, I believe I can relate to and connect with individuals from other backgrounds, giving me the capacity to see things from several angles, giving me a wider picture and a more global perspective.
